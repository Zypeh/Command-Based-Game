# Text-Based-Game

### Branches
*"Old" - The first attempt of coding/making this game.

*"Master" - The most stable code of the game. Coded in C#.

*"Port" - The C++ port of the game, will merge into master and ultimately replace the C# code with C++ code.

##About this project branch:

###Why port to C++?
C# takes a huge amount of RAM (3MB > 1MB) as it needs a runtime (it does, when we decided to port CBG to C++, and still does now. We decided that trading memory off for productivity is not feasible, as we want this game to run on as many platforms as possible.)

###Todos:
- Handling command history
- Majority of game logic (importance are sorted ascendingly!)
  * Player statuses(from health to stamina)
  * Item system
  * Time system
  * Inventory system
  * Combat system
  * Weather, maybe?
- Don't know, maybe Pizzas? (delicious)

###Milestone:
- Command Line Handling
- GUI
- Shortcut Keys
- About Tab
- Icon Scaling
